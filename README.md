# Image Caption Generator

## :bulb: Introduction
The **Image Caption Generator** is a deep learning-based project designed to automatically generate descriptive captions for input images. It employs two powerful models: **VGG16 + LSTM** and **DenseNet201 + LSTM**. These models extract rich visual features from images and generate corresponding captions, offering a robust solution for image understanding and natural language generation.

## :package: Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of **8,000 images**, each paired with **five descriptive captions**. The images span various scenes, including:
- :house_with_garden: **Indoor and outdoor environments**
- :shopping_cart: **Objects**
- :bust_in_silhouette: **People**
- :sunny: **Activities**

This variety provides a comprehensive basis for training and evaluating the models.

## :computer: Models

### Model 1: VGG16 + LSTM
This model combines the **VGG16** convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction with an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** network for generating captions.  
**VGG16** is a renowned architecture for image classification, and **LSTM** excels at handling sequential data such as text.

### Model 2: DenseNet201 + LSTM
The second model uses the **DenseNet201** CNN architecture, known for its dense connectivity, which helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and encourages feature reuse. Like the first model, **LSTM** is used for caption generation.

**Generated Caption:** "A woman with a backpack walking through a park on a sunny day."

## :star: Conclusion
The **DenseNet201 + LSTM** model consistently outperforms the **VGG16 + LSTM** model in generating more accurate and contextually relevant captions, thanks to its advanced architecture. This makes it the recommended model for generating image captions in this project.
